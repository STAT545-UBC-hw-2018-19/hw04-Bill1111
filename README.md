# Welcome to William Hall's STAT545 Homework #3 repository

In this assignment, I dug more into the use of the Kable function to make my tables more pretty, and the joining functions to combine datasets. 

Here are some of the resources I used:

- http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html
- https://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWjqLW-u3hc&feature=youtu.be&t=15m31s
- https://datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/04-dplyr.html

The biggest problem I ran into was using the group_by and summarise function. I think my problem was that I hadn't loaded the proper libraries and cleared my environment. After pulling some hair out, I've definitely learned that starting from a clean slate everytime you begin a new analysis is the way to go.
